Target of this Puredata abstractions library is to provide an intuitive simple set of objects to patch physical models of real or fantasy sounding objects.
Many of them are simplified in favor for more intuitive handling of waveguide elemtents and insttruments and do not always follow the strict waveguide theory.
The theory of most of the algorithms are based on the wonderful online documents about waveguides from Julian O. Smith III [JOS] at CCRMA Standford University.

.. [JOS] see https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/wg.html, Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA),   Stanford University

Some instruments are implemented as examples and provided to serve as a start for own instruments and experiments.
The 'acre' systematic with directories as prefixes is used to organize them. (see general acre documentation in '../docu').

Within physical modeling, the more sophisticated the models are, the more expressive parameters are needed to handle them and mostly the more difficult is to play them.
Therefore in some of the instruments, the parameters are simplified and combined, to allow an easier intuitive playing and also values are mapped to a more intuitive range.

Needed libraries: zexy, iemlib1, iemlib2, iemmatrix, iem_ambi
 libraries not installed in the system, can be copied to "libs/"
 (thus if checkout fresh it should be empty)

Objects
-------

Most objects are explained in their patches.
An overview is provided here:

wave:
 wave/ctl
 wave/out~
 wave/in~
 
 waveguide as a double delay, forward and backward, organized in two objects, 'in~' and 'out~', in favour for more lucid Pd patches. A possibility for "order forcing" is provided, to control where the loopback delay, controlled with the blocksize, will be added.

 The minimum delay time, and therefore high frequencies, is limited by the block size, so the blocksize in the example instruments are adjusted in the parent patch, if needed, with the ``switch~`` object.
 
 As a GUI 'ctl'  can be used to show the delay-time, which is mostly driven by other controls.

mic:
 mic/mix_ctl
 mic/mix_ds
 mic/mix~

 mic/mix~ is used to extract a signal out of a waveguide at a certain position, adding the forward and backward waves.
  
port:
 port/3_ctl
 port/split3~
 port/split3_ds
 port/3-damp~
 port/3~
 port/split3~-help
 port/split3_ctl
 port/3-damp_ctl

 Ports should be named "junctions" and are objects which have two or more ports to connect to a waveguides ins and outs or other signal source or sink.
 
 Some special junctions, like with damping function are also collected here.
 Note: this could/should be expanded to port/2~, port/4~ and so on, but since they has not been needed and therefore tested until now are omitted.

excite:
 excite/pluck~
 excite/pluck_ctl
 excite/pluck_ds
 excite/burst~
 excite/burst_ctl
 excite/burst_ds
 excite/bow~
 excite/bow_ctl
 excite/bow_ds

 Some signal generators to excite a waveguide feedback networks. 
 They are best documented within the examples. 

blow:
 blow/noise~
 blow/noise_ctl
 blow/noise_ds
 blow/pressure~
 blow/pressure_ctl

 blow a reed, where noise is combined with pressure, see clarinet.
 This is separated from 'excite', since it combines pressure with noise in a special way.

damp:
 damp/decay~
 damp/decay_ds
 damp/filt~
 damp/filt_ds
 damp/simple~
 damp/simple_ds
 damp/simple_ctl

 Simple damping with low-pass and a high pass, which also to filter out the DC is combined in 'simple~'.
 DC filtering is mostly needed because of on feedback inaccuracies, which can accumulate DC easily, but can also influence the effect of non-linear excitation objects, so must be carefully added. 
 
 Use damp where simple damping in feedback loop is needed.
 Decay additional reduces/destroys energy in a loop, so ports reflection factors are influenced. 
 Most parameters are scaled from 0..100 for easier control.
 
 Note that any filter mostly adds additional frequency dependent delays and therefore needs correction for excat tuning of instruments.

filt:
 filt/pipebell~
 filt/pipebell_ctl
 filt/pipebell_ds


 this group of objects are 'static' filter like cases, membranes, bellbipes, ...


reed:
 reed/simple~

 is a special non-linear feedback and injection of blow especially for reed instruments, see clarinet.

bow
 bow/table_ds
 bow/table_ctl
 bow/table~
 
 Bow junction, see in examples 'string/bowed'

shape:
 shape/limit~
 shape/limit_ctl
 shape/limit_ds

 shape objects are used to influence excitation of a signal.
 Since they are mostly non-linear, energy preservation is an issue.
 The amp factor is used how intensive they are applied.
 As an example limit, limits the excitation (see split string).

limiter:
 limiter/dsp~

 Sometimes to master waveguide instruments limiter are needed. 
 The standard limiter, crack limits the maximum signal value (-1..+1). 
 It can be used for very long or infinitely sustains.
 
 Note: A small delay of 9 samples is added for the limiter to work exactly.
 For physical limit see shape object.

adsr
 adsr/unpack
 adsr/ctl
 adsr/ctl_200
 adsr/adsr_ds
 adsr/drive
 adsr/ds
 adsr/pack
 adsr/vgen~
 
 For playing instruments adsr comes handy. 
 Here is one provided to be independent from other libraries.

init:
 init/ctl
 init/bang

 to reinitialize the waveguides and instruments. 
 A secure initialization is important, since physical models easily can go crazy.
 It is recommended to use it also in your patch for a kind of reset.

data
 data/songs/mid2qlist
 data/songs/noteon_timer_dropnoteoff
 
 data for initialization and demos.
